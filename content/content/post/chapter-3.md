“Stop listening to your professors … Go and live all kind of spaces all over
the world. That is the best you can do. Until then, you are going to enjoy
architecture”, he cautions our photographer, a young aspiring architect, while
he prepares to be portrayed.

Seconds later, he shamelessly gives to the camera the last warning: “This
column is very annoying. It would be better not to have it”, referring to the
interior of the Do&Co Hotel in Vienna —originally named Haas House— designed
by a key figure of the Postmodern architecture, the Austrian Hans Hollein
(1934-2014).

He is Benjamín Romano, a Mexican architect and urbanist without filters in his
statements, who graduated from the Ibero-American University in Mexico City,
and, as well, coursed Precast elements studies in Israel.

1978 was the year when, in parallel of concluding his bachelor degree, he
accomplished his first professional project, an industrial complex in 42,000
Sq m under the direction of the well-respected engineer Heberto Castillo
(1928-1997).

A contemporary vision which goes hand in hand with high technology, an
interpretation of the geology through the use of solid materials, and free
spaces devoid of pillars are the hallmarks of this international lecturer.

Thus, with a broad scope of proposals that include educational, health,
residential, office, industrial, and commercial programs, the founder of LBR&A
studio farewelled himself demonstrating his naivety once again: “I am a very
engineer-architect, or vice versa, a very architect-engineer. From time to time,
I do not even understand what I am more.”
